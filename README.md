Throw your shoes at pedestrians and the police that try to stop you!

Your rental car is severely damaged, and will explode if you crash into anything. 

The gas pedal is broken and the brakes can only last for so long before they catch fire! Keep track of the indicator by your mouse to see when it's safe to use them.
